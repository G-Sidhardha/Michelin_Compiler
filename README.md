<b>Michelin</b> is a language that can be used by a hypothetical robot for cooking food. We're developing it as a group project under the Compilers-II course at IIT Hyderabad. <br>

## Installation

As of now, the primary dependency needed in order to install our language is OCaml. <br>
So please make sure that OCaml is installed in your environment prior to running any .miche files on the Michelin Compiler. You can refer <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html"> **to this** </a> in order to help you install OCaml.

Once you install OCaml, follow <a href="https://github.com/IITH-COMPILERS2/compilers-2-project-team-2-aug21/blob/main/User%20Guide/install.sh"> **this** </a> script to run a <name>.miche file.
