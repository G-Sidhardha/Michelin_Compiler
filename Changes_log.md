* Chapter 1:
No modifications. Added some examples.
* Chapter 2:
Modified the measurement data types to measurement units. Made the usage of arrays , strings and operators clearer with few examples.
* Chapter 3:
We added examples for most of the sections. We added a new section -- 3.5 to explain additional details. In Section 3.3, we removed “has-a” relationship related terminology.
* Chapter 4:
Changed language extension from .mln to .miche (since it was conflicting with an existing file extension).
Asking for clarification whether to include Python for simulation or maintain a log file generated by CPP for testing. Replaced the initial database idea with a simpler idea - maps (for now at least).
* Chapter 5: 
No modifications.
* Chapter 6:
We decided that this feature is out of our scope to implement and decided to remove it from our language for now.
