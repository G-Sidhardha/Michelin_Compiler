## Q) Why is the language Michelin introduced and the thought process behind it?
 Our language is designed to cook dishes by writing code! In a more generic way, our language helps to program a robotic machine to cook. It tries to simulate the process of cooking even for someone with bare minimum knowledge of cooking and programming.
	The motivation for making this language comes from the fact that cooking seems to innocuously incorporate many design features of modern OOPS languages and these seem to be very common-sense ideas to the common populace. Hence, it indeed seems feasible to design a language that uses the innate organizational qualities that people have to help cook food! It can help cook food with very precise measurements since it will be done through a machine.
	
View this <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/130uW308xI-FjIYbYGSOlc_NK-5afEX7C/view">ideal video</a> file[^*] to get a fair idea of the cooking robot. Note that in this video, the machine is specific to only one item while the machine we have in mind is somewhat more generic; in particular it can actually be programmed to perform different actions (by an external user) for cooking different dishes, as opposed to the limited number of actions the machine in the video performs.

## Q) Why is this programming language named Michelin?
Michelin stars are  considered a hallmark of fine dining by many of the worldâ€™s top chefs. The stars are awarded to restaurants that Michelin considers the very best in a given city, and recipients gain immense prestige and exposure along with the honor, with many seeing an increase in business after receiving their stars. A Michelin star is a badge of honor, regardless of how many a restaurant receives (between one and three, with three being the highest caliber).
So we named our programming language as michelin to indicate the fact it cooks delicious food with just the recipe as instructions and without interference of chefs.

<br /><br />
## Q) Are there any improvements planned for the language?

## Q) What language is used in the frontend ?
Ocaml is used for the frontend to do the lexing, parsing and semantic analysis part.

<br /><br />
## Q) What language is used in the backend ?
We use LLVM, C++ language for the backend.

<br /><br />
## Q) Is the language interpreted or compiled?
Michelin language is compiled.

<br /><br />
## Q) Security features of the language (code wise as well as componentwise )
The hardware aspects of the device help to ensure that the people operating it are away from any danger and can easily create dishes.
With respect to the technical aspects of the security these include the checking for the presence of ingredients which our compiler checks during run time and generates errors for the respective ingredients as well as proper checks are ensured to prevent wrong methods from being used with the wrong devices such as fry with a glass and so on.

We found this video a couple of months after we had proposed our idea. It was nice to see a partial implementation of the idea we had proposed!
