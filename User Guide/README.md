# Welcome to the <b>User Guide!</b>

Here we will be assisting you in understanding the overall structure of the codebase and some other brief details regarding the language.

# Prerequisites

As of now, the primary dependency needed in order to install our language is OCaml. <br>
So please make sure that OCaml is installed in your environment prior to running any .miche files on the Michelin Compiler. You can refer <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html"> **to this** </a> in order to help you install OCaml.

Once you install OCaml, follow <a href="https://github.com/IITH-COMPILERS2/compilers-2-project-team-2-aug21/blob/main/User%20Guide/install.sh"> **this** </a> script to run a <name>.miche file.


# File Structure 

The File Structure of the Project is as follows: <br>
![File Structure](https://github.com/IITH-COMPILERS2/compilers-2-project-team-2-aug21/blob/main/Miscellaneous/File_Struct.png)

<b>Root:</b> This is the landing page of the codebase. Under Root we have 3 directories as shown above.<br>
<b>User Guide:</b> Here we provide you basic information on the infrastructure of the language (and its codebase). <br>
<b>Michelin Files:</b> Here is where we store code files and documentation pertaining to the language itself. It has 2 sub-directories. <br>
<b>Miscellaneous:</b> Miscellaneous files pertaining to the codebase are stored here. <br>
<b>Language Files:</b> Here we store the actual code files which make up different parts of the compilation process of Michelin (as well as several demo files).
These are largely finalised code files (although they are very likely to be subject to some updates once in a while). One can view different folders such as Lexer, Parser, etc. and navigate through the required folder as desired. <span style="color:red"> We're still in the process of updating the folders in this file. </span> <br>
<b>Course Files:</b> Here we store files which are more relevant to the course's requirements itself (such as assignments, PPTs, etc.). We might also provide links to the appropriate links where certain code files are stored so that it becomes easier for the teaching staff to evaluate them.
