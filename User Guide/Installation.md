As of now, the primary dependency needed in order to install our language is OCaml.
So please make sure that OCaml is installed in your environment prior to running any .miche files on the Michelin Compiler. You can refer <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html"> **to this** </a> in order to help you install OCaml.

Once you install OCaml, follow <a href="https://github.com/IITH-COMPILERS2/compilers-2-project-team-2-aug21/blob/main/User%20Guide/install.sh"> **this** </a> script to run a <name>.miche file.
